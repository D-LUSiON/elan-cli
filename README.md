# ElAn-CLI

## What is ElAn?

Tired of setting up everything up from scratch when creating your new Electron/Angular application?
ElAn is here to help you with the whole process because it's the all-in-one solution for creating Electron applications with Angular front-end!

## Installation

Install ElAn as global dependency:

```npm install -g elan-cli```

## Usage
For now you can use following commands:

**elan init [your-project-name]** - creates a new project and setups it

**elan serve [?project-name]** - starts dev environment so you can develop your app

**elan build [?project-name]** - builds the app for production

**elan help [?command]** - displays help on commands

**elan version** - displays versions of globaly installed ElAn, Electron and Angular CLI

## Working functionality
*(tested only on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 18.04)*

- Creation of a project with **elan init [project-name]**
- Serving in development mode with **elan serve [project-name]**
- Building with **elan build [project-name]** for Windows 10 and Ubuntu 18.04
- Support for multi-project Angular front-end

## Roadmap
*Planned functionality*

- Write proper documentation
- Init Angular multi-project
- Create resources from image for compiler
- Initialize with template (like Ionic)
- Setup TypeScript for Electron
- Setup if project uses local index.html or loads Express http server
