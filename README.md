# ElAn-CLI

*WIP! RC1 is coming to town! Soon ElAn-CLI will be part of npm family! Have a little more patience :)*

## What is ElAn?

Tired of setting up everything up from scratch when creating your new Electron/Angular application?
ElAn is here to help you with the whole process because it's the all-in-one solution for creating Electron applications with Angular front-end!

## Installation
You cannot install ElAn from npm yet. But if you want to do it, here are the steps:

1. Clone this repo in a directory of your choosing.
2. Enter the directory and run **npm install**
3. Run **npm i -g** to install it as a global dependancy on your machine

## Usage
For now you can use following commands:

**elan init [your-project-name]** - creates a new project and setups it

**elan serve** - starts dev environment so you can develop your app

**elan build** - builds the app for production

**elan help** - displays help on commands

**elan version** - displays versions of globaly installed ElAn, Electron and Angular CLI

## Working functionality
*(tested only on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 18.04)*

- Creation of a project with **elan init [project-name]**
- Serving in development mode with **elan serve [project-name]**
- Building with **elan build [project-name]** for Windows 10 and Ubuntu 18.04
- Support for multi-project Angular front-end

## Roadmap
*Planned functionality*

- Write proper documentation
- Init Angular multi-project
- Create resources from image for compiler

## Credits
ElAn will not be possible without all these hard working people and their open source projects:

- Electron
- Angular
- Electron builder
- Nodemon
- and all other that these projects depend on...
