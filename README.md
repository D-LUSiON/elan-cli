# ElAn-CLI - All-in-one solution for creating Electron applications with Angular front-end

*Development in progress! Nothing still works and it cannot be used before RC1 is released!*

You cannot install ElAn as a node module yet. But if you want to do it, here are the steps:

1. Clone this repo in a directory of your choosing.
2. Enter the directory and run **npm install**
3. Run **npm i -g** to install it as a global dependancy on your machine

For now you can use following commands:

**elan new [your-project-name]** - creates a new project and setups it

**elan serve** - starts dev environment so you can develop your app

**elan build** - builds the app for production (tested only on Windows 10)
